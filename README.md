![Screenshot](/screenshot.JPG)

Written in Org mode

## How to setup
Git clone this repo wherever you want, and just insert the following at the top of your init file
```
(package-initialize)
(require 'org)
(org-babel-load-file "~/emacs-config/configuration.org")
```
And adjust the path to the location of where you git cloned.

### For Windows Users
I tried to make this config also work on Windows. Obviously it won't be as good.
You will need to do some extra things:
- Install [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/) at `C:\cygwin64\`
- Install [Aspell](http://aspell.net/win32/) at `C:\Aspell\` with at least one dictionary

## Overview
