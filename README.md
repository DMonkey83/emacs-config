# Personal Emacs Configuration

![Screenshot](/screenshot.JPG)

Written in Org mode

## How to setup
Git clone this repo wherever you want, and just insert the following at the top of your init file
```
(setq config-load-path "~/emacs-config/")

(defvar my-start-time (current-time) "Time when Emacs was started")
(shell-command (concat "cd " config-load-path " && git pull"))
(package-initialize)
(require 'org)
(org-babel-load-file (concat config-load-path "configuration.org"))
(org-babel-load-file (concat config-load-path "cheatsheet.org"))
(message "Start up time %.2fs" (float-time (time-subtract (current-time) my-start-time)))
```
And adjust config-load-path to the location of where you git cloned.
This will also automatically pull the latest version of the config on startup.

### For Windows Users
I tried to make this config also work on Windows. Obviously it won't be as good.
You will need to do some extra things:
- Install [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/) at `C:\cygwin64\`
- Install [Aspell](http://aspell.net/win32/) at `C:\Aspell\` with at least one dictionary

## How to use
Most of the useful key bindings linked to this config are recorded in a cheat sheet that you can summon via
```
M-x cheatsheet-show
```

## Essential Packages
- Helm. After a full year of playing with both, finally chose Helm over Ido.
- Company. For code completion.
- Whole-line-or-region. Underrated IMO.
- Magit. Best git client for Emacs out there.
- Flycheck. Checks syntax everywhere.
- use-package. Amazing for a clean config file.
